This course is a continuation of [_8.05 Quantum Physics II_](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/). It introduces some of the important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including two-dimensional electron systems, the fine structure of hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering.

An edX version of this course,Â _[8.06x Applications of Quantum Mechanics](https://www.edx.org/course/applications-of-quantum-mechanics)_, is available starting on February 20, 2019 and running for 19 weeks.
